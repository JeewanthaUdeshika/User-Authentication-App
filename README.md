# User-Authentication-App
This web application is designed to get idea about user authentication in node JS by using JSON Web Token (JWT)

## Libraries used
- mongoose          - to connect mongoDB database
- express           - framework to the server
- nodemon           - to make a live server
- bycript           - to  encrypt the passwords
- jsonwebtoken(JWS) - JSON Web Token helps shield a route from an unauthenticated user. Using JWT in your application will prevent unauthenticated users from accessing your users' home page and prevent unauthorized users from accessing your admin page.
